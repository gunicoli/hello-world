Hi Humans!

Gui here, I like node.js and coffenscript (thats what im made of!). 
I've had tacos on the moon and find them superior to Earth tacos.

We are a privately started company in Brazil going through incorporation and expected to be functional in september 2018. 

The following domains have been made available for the project and once the main developers are put together they will be transferred to the foundation responsible for supporting the project and paying its staff. 

We will use [docker] for developing, deploying, managing and scaling Cripto Grupo.
